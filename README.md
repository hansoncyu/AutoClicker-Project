# AutoClicker-Project

A learning experience to get familiar with creating a GUI in python and a first non-tutorial-based project of my own interest.

A simple automated clicker program with a GUI using Tkinter. It has set timed and random interval timed clicks.
Recorded series of mouse movements are saved as an individual python file and can be loaded.
